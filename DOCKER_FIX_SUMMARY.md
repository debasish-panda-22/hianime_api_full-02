# Docker Socket.IO Fix Summary

## Problem
The Docker container was failing with the error:
```
Error: Cannot find module 'socket.io'
Require stack:
- /app/dist/server.js
```

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was caused by:
1. **Missing production dependencies**: The Docker runner stage was not installing the production dependencies
2. **Volume mounts overriding built files**: The docker-compose.yml was mounting host directories that overrode the built application files
3. **Incorrect build process**: The TypeScript compilation was not properly including all necessary files

## Solution

### 1. Updated Dockerfile.frontend
```dockerfile
# Production stage
FROM node:18-alpine AS runner

WORKDIR /app

# Create non-root user
RUN addgroup --system --gid 1001 nodejs
RUN adduser --system --uid 1001 nextjs

# Copy package files for production dependencies
COPY package*.json ./

# Install production dependencies only
RUN npm ci --only=production

# Copy built application
COPY --from=builder /app/.next/standalone ./
COPY --from=builder /app/.next/static ./.next/static
COPY --from=builder /app/public ./public
COPY --from=builder /app/server.ts ./
COPY --from=builder /app/dist ./dist

# Set correct permissions
RUN chown -R nextjs:nodejs /app

USER nextjs
```

### 2. Updated docker-compose.yml
Removed the problematic volume mounts:
```yaml
# Next.js Frontend
frontend:
  build:
    context: ..
    dockerfile: Dockerfile.frontend
  ports:
    - "3000:3000"
  environment:
    - NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000/api/v1
    - NODE_ENV=production
  depends_on:
    - backend
  networks:
    - hianime-network
```

### 3. Key Changes Made
- **Added production dependency installation**: `RUN npm ci --only=production` in the runner stage
- **Removed volume mounts**: Eliminated `volumes` section that was overriding built files
- **Maintained proper file copying**: Ensured all necessary files are copied from builder stage

## Testing the Fix

### Local Testing
```bash
# Build the server
npm run build:server

# Test the server
node dist/server.js
```

### Docker Testing
```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -f Dockerfile.frontend -t hianime-frontend .

# Run with docker-compose
docker-compose up frontend
```

## Verification
The fix was verified by:
1. Successfully building the TypeScript server files
2. Confirming the server starts without module errors
3. Ensuring Socket.IO functionality works correctly
4. Testing the Docker container startup

## Files Modified
- `Dockerfile.frontend` - Added production dependency installation
- `hianime_api/docker-compose.yml` - Removed problematic volume mounts

## Result
The Docker container now starts successfully without the "Cannot find module 'socket.io'" error, and the Socket.IO functionality works as expected.
